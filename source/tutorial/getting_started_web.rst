Getting Started with the Web Version of PySSEM
==========================================

The web version of PySSEM allows users to create and configure simulations directly through the dashboard interface. This guide explains how to add inputs to your simulation using the web interface available at `PySSEM Dashboard <https://www.pyssem.space/dashboard/simulations>`_.

Accessing the Dashboard
------------------------
1. Navigate to the PySSEM dashboard at `https://www.pyssem.space/dashboard/simulations`.

Creating a New Simulation
--------------------------
1. Click on the **"Create Simulation"** button in the top right of the dashboard.
2. A form will appear where you can configure the simulation parameters.

Adding Inputs
-------------
1. Click the 'Advanced Options' button to expand the input fields.
2. Fill in all fields.
3. Click the button at the bottom of the page to begin to add species to the simulation. A flyout will appear with a list of species options to add to the simulation.

Submitting the Simulation
--------------------------
1. After configuring all parameters, click the **"Submit"** button to save your simulation.
2. The simulation will appear in the **"Community Simulations"** section of the dashboard.
3. Click the green **"Run"** button to start the simulation.
4. The simulation will be queued and run on the server. You can monitor its progress in the dashboard.

Viewing Results
---------------
1. Once the simulation is complete, you can view the results by clicking on the bar chart **"Results"** button in the dashboard.

Editing an Existing Simulation
------------------------------
1. Locate your simulation in the dashboard.
2. Click the pencil **"Edit"** button next to the simulation.
3. Modify the inputs as needed and click **"Update Simulation"** at the bottom to update the simulation.
